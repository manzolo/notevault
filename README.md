NoteVault is a **self-hosted, multi-user knowledge base** that combines a Markdown note editor with a fully encrypted secrets vault. Notes are organised with tags, searchable via PostgreSQL full-text search, and can have file attachments and URL bookmarks. All sensitive values are stored encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. The entire stack runs in Docker and is managed through a single `Makefile`.

## Screenshots

### Dashboard — full-text search with attachment match

![Dashboard search](docs/screenshots/dashboard-search.png)

The search bar queries note titles, content, attachment text, bookmark URLs and descriptions in real time. When a match is found inside a file attachment, the filename appears as a clickable chip directly in the result card — click **Preview** to open the file inline without leaving the page.

### Note detail — secrets, attachments and bookmarks

![Note detail](docs/screenshots/note-detail.png)

Each note is a self-contained workspace: a Markdown body, an encrypted secrets vault (API keys, passwords, certificates, SSH keys…), file attachments with inline preview, and URL bookmarks — all on a single page. Secrets can be copied to the clipboard silently (without ever displaying the value on screen) or revealed for 30 seconds before being automatically hidden.

## Features

- **Multi-user with JWT authentication** — each user has an isolated workspace; tokens use HS256 and expire after 7 days.
- **Markdown note editor with live preview** — write in Markdown and see a rendered preview side by side in real time.
- **Tags** — organise notes freely with colour-coded tags; tags are also assignable to attachments and bookmarks.
- **Full-text search with pagination** — powered by PostgreSQL `tsvector` columns and a `GIN` index; searches across note titles, content, attachment text, attachment descriptions, bookmark titles, URLs, and descriptions. Results are paginated.
- **File attachments** — upload files to notes (PDF, images, text, Markdown, …); text is extracted automatically for full-text search. Each attachment can have an optional description and tags.
- **URL bookmarks** — attach bookmarked URLs with title, description, and tags to any note; bookmarks are fully searchable.
- **Encrypted secrets vault** — store API keys, passwords, and other sensitive values encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a `MASTER_KEY` that never touches the database. Password-type secrets support an optional plaintext `username` field.
- **Per-user rate-limited secret reveal** — secrets are revealed on demand and auto-hidden after 30 seconds; the reveal endpoint is rate-limited via Redis to prevent brute-force access. Values can also be copied silently to the clipboard without ever being displayed on screen.
- **Audit logging** — every create, update, delete, and reveal action is logged with timestamps and user context; secret values are always redacted from audit records.
- **Dark mode** — full dark mode support across all pages and components.
- **Internationalisation (English + Italian)** — the frontend ships with full `en` and `it` translations; locale is determined by the URL prefix (`/en/...`, `/it/...`).
- **Docker-based deployment** — the stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, frontend) is managed entirely through Docker Compose and a `Makefile`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker >= 24 and Docker Compose v2
- Python 3.x (only needed for the `make keygen` helper, uses the standard library)
- GNU Make

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manzolo/notevault.git
cd noteVault

# 2. Generate cryptographic keys
make keygen
# Output example:
#   SECRET_KEY=<base64-encoded 32-byte value>
#   MASTER_KEY=<base64-encoded 32-byte value>

# 3. Create your environment file and paste the generated keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in SECRET_KEY, MASTER_KEY, DB_PASSWORD, etc.

# 4. Build images and start all services
make build
make up

# 5. Run database migrations
make migrate

# 6. Open the application
# http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note:** On first run, `make build` compiles the backend and frontend images. This may take a few minutes. Subsequent builds use Docker's layer cache.

```

In production, a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx Proxy Manager) sits in front of the frontend container. The frontend's Next.js server proxies all `/api/*` requests internally to the backend — the backend is never exposed publicly.

## Security

- **Keys never logged** — `SECRET_KEY` and `MASTER_KEY` are read from environment variables and are never written to application logs or the database.
- **Secrets encrypted at rest** — every secret value is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being persisted. The `MASTER_KEY` is the sole encryption root; losing it means losing access to all secrets.
- **Secret values redacted in audit logs** — the audit log records events and secret names, but values are always replaced with `[REDACTED]`.
- **Rate limiting on the reveal endpoint** — Redis enforces a per-user rate limit on `POST /api/secrets/{id}/reveal`.
- **Auto-hide after 30 seconds** — once a secret is revealed in the UI, a client-side timer hides the plaintext automatically.
- **bcrypt 12 rounds** — user passwords are hashed with bcrypt at a cost factor of 12.
- **CORS** — the backend accepts requests only from origins listed in `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- **Deploy secrets stay local** — server-specific configuration (`DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_PATH`) lives in `.env.deploy` which is gitignored and never committed.

> **Key rotation:** To rotate `MASTER_KEY`, decrypt all secrets with the old key, re-encrypt with the new key, and update `.env` before restarting. There is no automated rotation tool in the current release.

## Internationalisation

NoteVault uses [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) with `localePrefix: 'always'`. Every page URL includes the locale as the first path segment.

| Locale | URL prefix | Translation file |
|---|---|---|
| English | `/en/...` | `frontend/messages/en.json` |
| Italian | `/it/...` | `frontend/messages/it.json` |

The default locale is `en`. Visiting `/` redirects to `/en/`.

---

## API Overview

The REST API is served by FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive documentation is available at `/docs` (Swagger UI) when `DEBUG=true`.

| Endpoint group | Base path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | `/api/auth` | Register, login, token refresh |
| Notes | `/api/notes` | CRUD for notes with pagination |
| Tags | `/api/tags` | Create, list, assign tags |
| Search | `/api/search` | Full-text search with pagination |
| Attachments | `/api/notes/{id}/attachments` | Upload, list, stream, delete file attachments |
| Bookmarks | `/api/notes/{id}/bookmarks` | CRUD for URL bookmarks |
| Secrets | `/api/secrets` | CRUD for encrypted secrets, reveal endpoint |
| Database health | `/api/database` | Internal health check |

All protected endpoints require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

---

## Environment Variables

### Application (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate before starting the stack.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | **yes** | — | Base64-encoded 32-byte key for JWT signing. Generate with `make keygen`. |
| `MASTER_KEY` | **yes** | — | Base64-encoded 32-byte key for AES-256-GCM secret encryption. Generate with `make keygen`. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | **yes** | — | Password for the `notevault` PostgreSQL user. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | no | set by compose | Full async SQLAlchemy connection string. Set automatically by Docker Compose. |
| `REDIS_URL` | no | `redis://redis:6379/0` | Redis connection URL. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | no | `http://localhost:3000` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins. In production set to your public domain. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | no | `/api` | **Baked into the frontend bundle at build time.** Defaults to `/api` (domain-agnostic). Only set for cross-origin setups (e.g. `http://notevault.lan`). |
| `DEBUG` | no | `false` | Enable FastAPI debug mode and Swagger UI. Must be `false` in production. |

### Deploy configuration (`.env.deploy`, gitignored)

Copy `.env.deploy.example` to `.env.deploy` and fill in your server details. This file is **never committed** to git.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | SSH target, e.g. `root@your-server.lan` |
| `DEPLOY_PATH` | Absolute path on the remote host, e.g. `/root/notevault` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Optional — defaults to `/api` (domain-agnostic). Only set for cross-origin setups. |

### Frontend build variable (baked at build time)

| Variable | Default in Dockerfile | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` | `http://notevault-backend:8000` | Internal URL used by the Next.js server to proxy `/api/*` requests to the backend. Default is correct for both dev and production Docker deployments. |
